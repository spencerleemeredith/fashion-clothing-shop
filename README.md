# Getting Started
```
git clone https://github.com/spencerleemeredith/fashion-clothing-shop.git
cd fashion-clothing-shop
npm install
npm start
```

An ecommerce shop that uses the fake store API to pull product data. It's filtered to only show Men's and Women's clothing. It has a responsive design, created with tailwind. 
With React I separated the data between product, sidebar, and cart data. Which is then used in conjunction with the components, home, and product page to display information seamlessly all across.

# Built-With
- React
- React Router
- Fake Store API
- Tailwind
